For each of the statements, choose the number matching the answer that <u>best describes how you think</u>. Because people are different, there are no right or wrong answers.<br><br>
To decide whether a given statement is typical of your way of looking at things, simply keep in mind what you are like <u>most of the time</u>."	0	2
